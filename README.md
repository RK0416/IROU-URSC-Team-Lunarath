# IROU-URSC-Team-Lunarath

Problem Statement:

Navigation Task 

The team is required to design for demonstration of performance of the rover waypoint 
navigation in commanded and autonomous mode. The requirements for the rover design 
need to be generated based on the following asks of the navigation task: 
a) Obstacle identification using sensors: The obstacles given are 150 mm X 150 mm X 
150 mm and 300 mm X 300 mm X 300 mm. The sensors serve to identify the dimension 
of the obstacles. 
b) Obstacle avoidance/traversal by mobility system: The rover must be capable of 
traversing over 150 mm X 150 mm X 150 mm obstacles avoiding the 300 mm X 300 
mm X 300 mm obstacles.
c) Crater identification using sensors: The craters of spherical shape are created of 
diameters 200 mm and 400 mm. The sensors serve to identify the dimension of the 
craters. 
d) Crater avoidance/traversal by mobility system: The rover must be capable of traversing 
through craters of diameter 200 mm avoiding the 400 mm diameter craters. 

Sample Picking Task 
The sample pick and place task needs to be accomplished by a manipulator arm mounted 
on the chassis. 
a) Target identification using visual sensors: The sample target of following details needs 
to be identified successfully before picking it up. 
Details of sample collection tube: 
Mass: ~ 200 gm 
Shape:  Hollow Cylinder with closed ends 
Size: OD 80 mm, ID 70 mm, L 125 mm (Approx.) 
Material: 3D Printed ABS 
Colour:  Red 
b) Picking and loading on the rover chassis: The sample tube needs to be picked up from 
the surface using a gripper. The sample then needs to be placed securely on the rover 
before starting the mobility. 
c) Target location identification: A cylindrical container of diameter 150 mm and height 
150 mm placed at the target location needs to be identified. 
d) Unloading and placement: The rover to approach target, unload the sample inside the 
cylindrical container. 
e) Final Parking: After dropping the sample the rover has to be positioned within a circle 
of diameter 1500 mm from final point.
